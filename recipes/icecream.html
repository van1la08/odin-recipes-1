			<h3>Homemade Ice Cream is the quintessential summer treat, isn’t it?</h3>
			<p>This homemade ice cream recipe can also be called the easiest (and best!) ice cream you will ever make or taste. I’ve been making this ice cream at least once a month for over 5 years now.</p>
			<p>Can anyone ever turn down a scoop of rich and creamy vanilla ice cream? This ice cream recipe is the easiest once I make and it’s adaptable for whichever add-ins you’re craving.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>1cup heavy cream</li>
					<li>1cup whole milk</li>
					<li>half cup sugar</li>
					<li>1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
					<li>1  tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Steps:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Pour 1 cup of the cream into a saucepan and add the sugar, salt. Scrape the seeds of the vanilla bean into the pot and then add the vanilla pod to the pot.

Stir to combine and chill in the refrigerator.</li>
